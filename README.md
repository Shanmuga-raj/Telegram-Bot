###### ```LIBRARIES USED:```
>#### Json <br />
>> Syntax To Install Json Module: pip install json <br />

>> Json is used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).
>#### Requests <br />

>> Syntax To Install Requests Module: pip install requests <br />

>> Requests module allows you to send HTTP Requests and return a Response with all the reponse data (content, encoding, status, etc..)
>#### Configparser <br />

>> Syntax To Install ConfigParser Module: pip install configparser <br />

>> Config files help creating the initial settings for any project, they help avoiding the hardcoded data. Imagine if you migrate your server to a new host and suddenly your application stops working, now you have to go through your code and search/replace IP address of host at all the places. Config file comes to the rescue in such situation. You define the IP address key in config file and use it throughout your code. Later when you want to change any attribute, just change it in the config file.
